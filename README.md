# Password Complexity Checker

## Objective

The goal is to create a Python function that checks the complexity of a password based on several criteria:
- **Length**: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
- **Uppercase Letters**: The password must contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
- **Lowercase Letters**: The password must contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
- **Digits**: The password must contain at least one digit (0-9).
- **Special Characters**: The password must contain at least one special character from the set `!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>`.

## Implementation

### Function Definition

The function `passchecker(password)` performs the following checks:

1. **Length Check**:
   - It first checks if the length of the password is at least 8 characters.
   - If the password is too short, it returns a message: `"The password length must be at least 8 characters."`

2. **Uppercase Letter Check**:
   - It loops through the password to find any uppercase letter using the `isupper()` method.
   - If no uppercase letter is found, it returns: `"Password must contain at least one uppercase letter."`

3. **Lowercase Letter Check**:
   - It similarly checks for the presence of at least one lowercase letter using the `islower()` method.
   - If no lowercase letter is found, it returns: `"Password must contain at least one lowercase letter."`

4. **Digit Check**:
   - The function checks for at least one digit using the `isdigit()` method.
   - If no digit is found, it returns: `"Password must contain at least one digit."`

5. **Special Character Check**:
   - It verifies that the password includes at least one special character from a predefined set.
   - If no special character is found, it returns: `"Password must contain at least one special character."`

6. **Final Output**:
   - If all the above criteria are met, the function returns: `"Good password."`
